    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>4 shallots</li>
        <li>25 g ginger</li>
        <li>15 g turmeric</li>
        <li>75 g young galangal</li>
        <li>1 tbsp ground fresh red chile pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>½ pod dried nutmeg</li>
        <li>2 candlenuts</li>
        <li>½ tbsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp gula jawa (Indonesian palm sugar)</li>
        <li>1 kg beef, cut into big cubes to make 20 pieces</li>
        <li>4 lime leaves</li>
        <li>1 stalk lemongrass</li>
        <li>2 L ready-to-use coconut milk or coconut milk from 1 big fresh coconut</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Using a food processor, grind together all the ingredients for the spice paste.</li>
        <li>Marinate meat with the spice paste for at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Heat the coconut milk over low heat until some oil rises to the surface (at least 20 minutes). Stir the coconut milk while it is cooking.</li>
        <li>Transfer the meat and spice paste mixture to a large wok or pot. Cover with 300 ml of the hot coconut milk.</li>
        <li>Stirring occasionally, cook over medium-low heat until half of the coconut milk has evaporated.</li>
        <li>Add another 100 ml hot coconut milk, and stir until almost all of the coconut milk has evaporated.</li>
        <li>Keep on adding coconut milk, 100 ml at a time, and cooking until the previous addition has evaporated.</li>
        <li>Cook until the meat is tender (at least 1½ hours) and almost all the liquid from the coconut milk has reduced to a spicy sauce.</li>
    </ol>
